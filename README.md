"Classifier Algorithms"
*  A script that creates a table (with precision, recall, f1-score, and support), a confusion matrix, and an accuracy calculation. The data is saved to corresponding CSV Files. 
*  This script is an improvement on the mainMLScript to include the ability to allow the user to choose which classifiers they'd like and send the results to a CSV file rather than printing to the Python console
*  Support file is featureExtraction and rawData128SinglePoint. In the future, someone will have to save new data in the same format as this file.
